**Book Review: The Phoenix Project**

This book is not my usual choice of reading material. The first half of the book is a bombardment of decision errors and disorganization. This large public company has too many people doing their own thing. It is three years behind schedule on their most important project. The left hand has no clue what the right is doing. The company lacks team collaboration, there is too much finger pointing, no accountability, over dependency on certain employees, power struggles and individual agendas. The Company’s IT department is constantly “firefighting” problems, is in continual crisis, while developers put out “spaghetti code” and the outdated infrastructure is causing them to fall behind on their competitors. 

In the second half of the book sees the implementation of DevOps. Using DevOps the developers become more agile and release code more frequently. From the IT operations side, DevOps requires standardization in the test and production environments, along with automation of packaging the code releases, standardizing processes and troubleshooting techniques executing the Theory of Constraints (ToC). Character Erik teaches Bill about limiting demand, visualizing, understanding how the IT department should run by teaching in a round-a-bout way the three scientifically grounded management movements: 1. The Theory of Constraints, 2. Lean Production and 3. Total quality management. The companies game changer Phoenix Project is three years behind schedule with twenty million dollars invested. The CEO, Steve, eventually adopts “The Way” and this allows the company to deploy new code and updates within record time and as often as needed.

So, what exactly is ToC and Lean Production? My work revolves around building protocols and methodologies for experiments where both mentioned theories play a significant role. Protocols are developed in a Leaner manner, while lab organization, personal and equipment trends toward the ToC way of functioning.
ToC takes a scientific approach to improvement. It hypothesizes that every complex system, including manufacturing processes, consists of multiple linked activities, one of which acts as a constraint upon the entire system. ToC believes that a system/process is only as good as the activities that limit it. Fewer limits means performance. The objective is to improve the weakest area(s) of a process and increase the throughput of quality services and products. Once constraints are addressed, the organization then starts the cycle over again, examining the process to identify any new constraints and take steps to remove them. 

The ToC consists of three ideas and states that improvement made anywhere beside the bottleneck are an illusion.
- _The Flow_ – understanding how to create fast work flow from Development into IT operations. Increase the flow but never let the defects make it downstream.

An organized flow of work in any project is necessary for its success. To ensure a good flow in a laboratory a trusted system of resources is needed and cannot be tangled up in something else. Personnel that is trained and focused must be present, and working equipment must be available that is free of congestion. In scientific research, there is a protocol - a step by step instruction hand book explaining precisely how the experiment is to run and it’s never altered in anyway. From experimenter to experimenter there should be no variability since everyone conducting the research should be participating in the exact same manner. Protocols are easier to execute if they are simpler or Leaner. Fewer steps means fewer errors. Alterations to the methods causes too much variation and unreliability and a disruption of “The Flow”, resulting in failure. 

A destroyer of “The Flow” is unplanned work. Unplanned work in the book was costing the staff 75% of their time pulling them away from critical planned work or work in progress (WIP). Too much WIP is one of the root causes for past due date problems. Work that is half complete, piling up and waiting to be completed is never good. It is a wasteful practice because it has consumed almost all the resources needed and hasn’t yet begun to return value. 
Once a constraint has been identified and exploited, the pace for the rest of the process must be adjusted to match that of the constraining step. This way, work does not pile up. Some experiments in my lab take 3-weeks of run time from start to finish. If personnel running this 3-week experiment are pulled from the job in the middle for unplanned work or equipment breaks the entire experiment is wasted since it cannot be picked up and resumed, it must be restarted from the beginning. Resources are wasted, data is unusable and the subjects are unusable till the next set time point, resulting in more work compared to completing the experiment in the first place.

- _Feedback_ - shorten and amplify feedback loops. Fix quality at the source and avoid rework. Remove the largest source of unplanned work.


The quicker you spot the potential for error the better. Putting a stop to anything faulty at the start saves time. Hence the saying “A stitch in time saves nine.” This is no place for corner cutting or people with no follow through. Before full investment of resources and time are utilized in research a variety of pilot tests are done to ensure that the experiment is set up for success and will withstand any peer review. Subjects to be tested are carefully chosen, the number of subjects chosen to withstand the statistical analyses, equipment best suited for the situation, which protocol steps are crucial and which trained personnel will be required. The sooner corrections are made in the pilot testing process the sooner a methods protocol is achieved. 

- _Continual Learning_ - the company must create a culture that simultaneously fosters experimentation, learning from failure, and understanding that repetition and practice equals mastery.


With age comes experience, wisdom, and realism all learned from failure. What has worked and what has not is a very beneficial weapon. Experience also supports that if something is repeated enough times it becomes habit/muscle memory and the process is mastered. However, youth brings with it naivetes, an anything is possible attitude, and out of the box thinking. The two are a winning combination. 

Currently my day is spent training and teaching experimenters how to run successful behavior experiments. Experience has taught me where experimental designs tend to have pit falls and where personnel tend to get trapped or fail to execute procedures effectively. When developing a protocol, the Lean Production way of work is more desirable. Lean Production focuses on maximizing value for both the customers and the organization. This is done by eliminating wasteful practices and streamlining the process. Lean practitioners spend time optimizing the flow of work so it continually adds value to the service or products and pulls work through the process. In a laboratory, the customers are the organizations that fund research grants. Laboratories eliminate waste in the way of not running experiments where results cannot be pin pointed, using equipment and subjects that are reliable and healthy, running experiments at time set points which allow for comparability over extensive periods of time. Value is added by choosing adequate subjects, optimal environmentally conditions and carefully limiting length of participation. The data collected is a numerical measurement of how the process is functioning and where future improvements to design can be made.

In the Phoenix Project, Erik wants Bill’s IT department to stop taking on new work until they can get things working efficiently, more simplified, and in a standardized and automated manner. Currently IT is spending valuable time “firefighting” and switching in the middle of tasks. Erik is encouraging Bill to figure out where the workflow bottlenecks (Brent and IT) are occurring so that it can be protected and efficiently worked around. Figuring out how to reduce batch size in the development process will be rewarded with faster feedback and better control of the outcome. Erik teaches Bill the four types of work and the issues that come with each and the Theory of Constraints helps Bill see the big picture, IT and its role in the company on a large-scale.

The second half of the book is all rainbows and unicorns farting glitter. Speaking of unicorns, what is it with the teams naming projects after one horned animals? There is an unrealistic timeline, it’s repetitious and could be 100 pages fewer. Within months everyone is on board with the simple changes being implemented to very complex entities. Friendships are made over drinks, everyone is so trusting in meetings and sharing ideas, management is baring their souls to crying colleagues. The swift change of the whole IT culture, automation of a multi department environment and deployment of applications all during a magnitude of crisis’s is unbelievable. Conflicts and problems disappear, for example, during an audit meeting Erik convinces an old friend, that is conveniently a partner in the audit firm, that the problems the company have on paper aren’t real IT control issues. IT, security and development all start working together seamlessly. Plans to outsource IT and break it free from the rest of the company is cancelled. Management is finally completely aligned after the ToC is implemented. Bill gets another promotion to CIO, is on a three-year fast track to become second in command. The quick turnaround from dysfunctional to profit returning is just too hard to believe. 

Ultimately, The Phoenix Project is relatable and entertaining. Even without an IT background I could easily see how the concepts could be applied to my workflow. The name of the survival game is to adapt to the real world and market, have good management leadership, face to face meetings really work and with genuine collaboration everyone can work together to resolve business problems in an agile and controlled manner. The take away is that IT process matters because IT is in the middle of every company’s major operations and is critical to the company’s daily operations.
